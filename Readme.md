## *Inequities in healthcare and how they might affect health outcomes*

<br />

## Abstract

Access to healthcare services greatly influences an individual's health outcome, and disparities in access are notably significant between urban and rural areas. By analyzing various datasets, our project aims to understand how healthcare access, characterized by the number of healthcare providers, distance to care, and access to virtual healthcare, affects cardiovascular disease outcomes in these areas. We aim to provide insights that could inform policy interventions and potentially reduce these disparities, thus promoting a more equitable healthcare system.

## Context

Healthcare access disparities between urban and rural areas are a significant issue in the United States. Factors such as the number of healthcare providers, distance to care, and availability of virtual healthcare have been identified as key indicators of these disparities. Such disparities can result in a lower quality of care, limited preventive services, delayed diagnosis, and ultimately poorer health outcomes, particularly in rural areas. 

Understanding the underlying factors contributing to these disparities and their impact on health outcomes, specifically for cardiovascular diseases, is crucial for developing effective interventions and policies. Solving this problem is critical not only from a social justice perspective but also from an economic and public health standpoint. 


## Proposal

The central question we aim to answer is: "What is the impact of differences in the number of healthcare providers, distance to care, and availability of virtual healthcare between rural and urban areas on cardiovascular disease outcomes, and what might be the potential effect of policy interventions aimed at reducing these disparities?‚Äù

To answer this question, we will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, relationships, and anomalies within the data. This will be followed by rigorous data cleaning, ensuring the quality and reliability of our analysis. Visualizations will help in effectively communicating patterns and correlations. Next, we will implement various machine learning models to understand and predict health outcomes based on healthcare access disparities. 

We expect to find correlations between access disparities and cardiovascular disease outcomes, and using this information, we will create a predictive model to forecast the potential impact of improving specific aspects of healthcare access in rural and urban areas.


## Conclusion

Disparities in healthcare access represent a pressing issue in our healthcare system. This project seeks to uncover the specific aspects of healthcare access driving these disparities, with a vision of using these insights to inform policy interventions that can reduce disparities and improve cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Our solution, using rigorous data analysis and predictive modeling, holds potential for making a significant contribution to the field of healthcare equity. While our immediate context is the disparities in cardiovascular disease outcomes in urban and rural areas, the methodology we employ can be generalized to understand and address similar issues in other fields of health and wellness. 

Of course, our project is not without its limitations. The public datasets may lack granularity or may not capture all the nuances of healthcare access disparities. Furthermore, despite our best efforts to infer causality, we acknowledge the potential for residual confounding given the observational nature of our data. Nevertheless, the findings from our project can provide important insights for future research and guide data-driven policy interventions. We look forward to collaborating with healthcare providers and policymakers to leverage these insights in practical, impactful ways.
