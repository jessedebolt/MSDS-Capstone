## *Inequities in healthcare and how they might affect health outcomes*

<br />

## Abstract

Imagine a world where your zip code, your race, or some other factor determines your health. By analyzing various datasets, we aim to uncover the underlying factors that contribute to inequities in healthcare, and how this may impact someone's health. We hope to gain valuable insights to inform policy changes and interventions that can promote a more equitable healthcare system.

## Context

Inequities in healthcare persist as a critical and long-standing issue in the United States. People from different racial and ethnic groups, differing geographies, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, often have a difference in access to healthcare, quality of care, and even different health outcomes. These disparities have far-reaching public health consequences, as they can lead to discriminating health outcomes and perpetuate systemic inequalities. 

Understanding the underlying factors contributing to healthcare inequities is crucial for developing effective interventions and policies to promote a more equitable healthcare system.  Solving these problems is critical, not just from a moral and social justice perspective, but also from an economic standpoint. Health disparities lead to increased healthcare costs, lost productivity, and lower quality of life. Furthermore, as our society becomes more diverse, these disparities are likely to have far broader impacts. Understanding the nature and causes of health disparities is thus an important step towards developing policies and interventions that promote health equity and improve our healthcare system.


## Proposal

This project aims to answer the question, "What are the specific socio-demographic factors contributing to healthcare inequities, and how do they affect people's health outcomes? ". We will use County Health Rankings & Roadmaps data, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, and U.S. Census Bureau data to address these questions.

To answer this question, we will first conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, relationships, and anomalies within the data. This will be followed by rigorous data cleaning, ensuring the quality and reliability of our analysis. Visualizations will help in effectively communicating patterns and correlations. Next, we will implement various machine learning models to understand and predict health outcomes based on socio-demographic factors. These models may include regression models, classification techniques, or possibly survival analysis, if appropriate. Our analysis will be supplemented by SQL for efficient data querying and manipulation.

We anticipate finding that factors such as income inequality, limited healthcare infrastructure in underserved areas, and implicit bias within the healthcare system play substantial roles in perpetuating healthcare disparities. By quantifying and understanding these factors, we aim to inform data driven policy changes and interventions. This information can be used to address inequities and promote a more equitable healthcare system, ultimately improving health outcomes for disadvantaged groups.


## Conclusion

Health disparities represent a critical issue in our healthcare system, influenced by a complex interplay of socio-demographic factors. This project seeks to uncover the specific factors driving these disparities, with a vision of using these insights to foster a more equitable healthcare system.

Our solution, utilizing rigorous data analysis and machine learning models, carries implications far beyond the specific context of health disparities. The methodology employed can be generalized to other fields facing similar issues of inequity, demonstrating the power of data science techniques in tackling complex societal issues.

Of course, this project is not without its limitations. Public datasets may lack granularity or may not capture all the nuances of the healthcare system. The observational nature of this analysis limits our ability to draw definitive causal conclusions. However, despite these constraints, the findings of this project can serve as a springboard for future research and can provide important directional insights. Future iterations of this project could involve integrating richer datasets, implementing more sophisticated models, and collaborating with healthcare providers or institutions to apply the insights in real-world settings. Regardless of these potential improvements, this project stands as a testament to the power of using data in promoting health equity and fostering positive societal change.
