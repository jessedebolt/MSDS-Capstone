### *Inequities in healthcare and how they might affect health outcomes*

<br />

### **30-Second (elevator) Pitch**

Imagine a world where your zip code, your race, or some other factor determines your health.

By analyzing various datasets, we aim to uncover the underlying factors that contribute to inequities in healthcare, and how this may impact someone's health.

We hope to gain valuable insights to inform policy changes and interventions that can promote a more equitable healthcare system.
