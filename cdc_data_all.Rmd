### Removing US territories
```{r}
#Use if needed to back up changes
#cdc <- cdc_copy

#Remove territories
cdc <- cdc %>%
  filter(!grepl("\\(AS\\)|\\(GU\\)|\\(MP\\)|\\(PR\\)|\\(County Equivalent\\)", as.character(display_name)))

head(cdc)

#cdc <- cdc_copy

```


### Relabeling Urban/Rural codes
```{r}

### Replacing '-1' with 'NA' under assumption that these are truly missing elements
cdc[cdc == -1] <- NA

```


### Review header names, check for missing rural/urban values
```{r}
names(cdc)

unique(cdc$'UrbanRural')

rural_query <- filter(cdc, `UrbanRural` %in% c(NA, "", "NA"))

head(rural_query, n=20)

### Inserting Rural/Urban for missing value
```{r}
# Find and insert where county is 'Kusilvak' based on Wikipedia data.
cdc$"UrbanRural"[grepl("Kusilvak", cdc$county)] <- "Rural"

unique(cdc$'UrbanRural')

# Double check for any NAs in Rural/Urban
rural_query <- filter(cdc, `UrbanRural` %in% c(NA, "", "NA"))
head(rural_query, n=20)

```


### Inserting Parks missing value
```{r}
# Find and insert where county is 'Kusilvak' based on average for all AK counties.
cdc$"Parks"[grepl("Kusilvak", cdc$county)] <- 66

```


### Checking for missing values
```{r}
#total number of missing values in dataset
sum(is.na(cdc))

#total number of missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(cdc))

#total number of missing values in each column
count_na_func <- function(x) sum(is.na(x)) 
cdc <- cdc %>%
  mutate(count_na = apply(., 1, count_na_func)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_na))

```


### Remove counties with minimal data
```{r}
# Remove those that have more than 8 NAs in that row
cdc <- cdc[cdc$count_na <= 8, ]

# Remove count_na column
cdc$count_na <- NULL

```

#### Linear Model with CHD vs various features Explanation:
**Residuals:**
The "Residuals" section provides information about the errors or residuals of the model. Residuals are the differences between the actual observed values and the predicted values from the regression model. This section displays summary statistics of the residuals, including the minimum, first quartile (1Q), median, third quartile (3Q), and maximum values.
In your model, the minimum residual is -4.1947, the first quartile is -0.6105, the median is -0.0589, the third quartile is 0.5536, and the maximum residual is 6.8327.

**Coefficients:**
The "Coefficients" section provides the estimated coefficients of the independent variables in the linear regression model. Each coefficient represents the expected change in the dependent variable (CHD) associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding other variables constant.
For example, the estimated coefficient for "CardioPhys" is -0.005596, indicating that, on average, for each unit increase in the "CardioPhys" variable, the dependent variable "CHD" is expected to decrease by approximately 0.005596 units, assuming all other variables are held constant.

The "Estimate" column shows the estimated coefficient values, the "Std. Error" column provides the standard errors of the estimates, and the "t value" column gives the t-statistic for testing whether the coefficient is significantly different from zero. The "Pr(>|t|)" column represents the p-value associated with the t-statistic, indicating the statistical significance of the coefficient. Lower p-values indicate greater significance.

In your model, all the coefficients have p-values less than 0.05, denoted by three asterisks (***), indicating that all the variables are statistically significant in explaining the variation in the dependent variable.

**Residual standard error:**
The "Residual standard error" is an estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals. It represents the average amount by which the observed values deviate from the predicted values. In your model, the residual standard error is 1.029.

**Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:**
The "Multiple R-squared" is a measure of how well the linear regression model fits the data. It indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. In your model, the multiple R-squared value is 0.5756, meaning that approximately 57.56% of the variance in the dependent variable "CHD" is explained by the independent variables in the model.

The "Adjusted R-squared" adjusts the multiple R-squared value for the number of independent variables and the sample size. It penalizes the addition of irrelevant variables that do not contribute much to the model's explanatory power. The adjusted R-squared value in your model is 0.5748.

**F-statistic:**
The F-statistic is a measure of overall significance in the linear regression model. It tests the null hypothesis that all the coefficients in the model are equal to zero, indicating that none of the independent variables have a significant relationship with the dependent variable. A low p-value (typically below 0.05) suggests that the model as a whole is statistically significant.
In your model, the F-statistic is 708.3, and the associated p-value is < 2.2e-16, which is essentially zero. This extremely low p-value indicates that the overall model is statistically significant, and at least one of the independent variables has a significant relationship with the dependent variable.

In summary, the linear regression model explains approximately 57.56% of the variance in the dependent variable "CHD." The coefficients of the independent variables are statistically significant, indicating that they have a significant relationship with "CHD" when controlling for other variables in the model. The model as a whole is statistically significant, suggesting that it provides valuable information in predicting the dependent variable.

#### Linear Model with CHD vs Urban Rural Explanation:
**Intercept (Large_Urban)**: In this model, "Large_Urban" is the reference category because it is represented by the intercept. The intercept's value of approximately 5.79 is the average CHD prevalence in "Large_Urban" areas (given that the CHD data and coefficients are in a format where this interpretation makes sense).

**LargeFringe_Urban**: The coefficient of approximately 1.01 suggests that, on average, the CHD prevalence in "LargeFringe_Urban" areas is estimated to be about 1.01 units higher than in "Large_Urban" areas.

**MediumSmall_Urban**: Similarly, the CHD prevalence in "MediumSmall_Urban" areas is estimated to be about 1.80 units higher than in "Large_Urban" areas.

**Rural**: Lastly, the CHD prevalence in "Rural" areas is estimated to be about 2.98 units higher than in "Large_Urban" areas.

For all categories of "UrbanRural", the p-values are less than 0.05, which suggests that the differences in CHD prevalence between "Large_Urban" areas and the other types of areas are statistically significant.

In other words, your model suggests that there is a significant association between the type of area and CHD prevalence. Specifically, all other types of areas have higher estimated CHD prevalence than "Large_Urban" areas.


### Linear Model CHD vs Urban Rural + HighBP
```{r}
# Fit models to each imputed dataset
models <- with(imputed_data, exp = lm(CHD ~ UrbanRural + HighBP))

# Pool results
pooled_results <- pool(models)

# Print summary of pooled results
summary(pooled_results)

```
#### Linear Model CHD vs Urban Rural + HighBP Explanation:
In your output, each row corresponds to a term in the model, and each column corresponds to an aspect of the term.

- **term**: This is the name of the variable in the model. "(Intercept)" refers to the model's intercept, or baseline outcome when all the predictors are 0. In your case, "UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban", "UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban", and "UrbanRuralRural" are dummy variables derived from the categorical variable "UrbanRural", and "HighBP" is a variable representing high blood pressure.

- **estimate**: This is the estimated coefficient for the term in the model. For example, the estimate for "HighBP" is 0.1983978. In the context of this model, it means that for each unit increase in "HighBP", we would expect an increase of 0.1983978 units in "CHD", holding all other variables constant.

- **std.error**: This is the standard error of the estimated coefficient. It measures the variability in the estimate. A smaller standard error means the estimate is more precise.

- **statistic**: This is the t-statistic for the term. It is the ratio of the estimate to the standard error. The t-statistic follows a t-distribution under the null hypothesis that the true coefficient is zero. A larger absolute value of the t-statistic means it is further from zero, which provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

- **df**: This is the degrees of freedom for the t-statistic.

- **p.value**: This is the p-value for the hypothesis test of whether the coefficient is zero. A smaller p-value means there is stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, i.e., stronger evidence that the coefficient is not zero.

In your output, all the p-values are very small, which suggests that each term in the model is significantly related to "CHD". Specifically:

- For a county that's "UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban" versus "Large_Urban", the expected "CHD" increases by 0.2928782 units, holding all other variables constant.
- For a county that's "UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban" versus "Large_Urban", the expected "CHD" increases by 0.7978104 units, holding all other variables constant.
- For a county that's "UrbanRuralRural" versus "Large_Urban", the expected "CHD" increases by 1.4393493 units, holding all other variables constant.
- For each unit increase in "HighBP", the expected "CHD" increases by 0.1983978 units, holding all other variables constant.

Therefore, your model suggests that "HighBP" and "UrbanRural" are both significant predictors of "CHD", with "HighBP" being a particularly strong predictor given its large t-statistic. This matches with what you might expect given that high blood pressure is known to be a risk factor for coronary heart disease.

#### Linear Model with various variables Explanation:
1. **(Intercept)**: The expected value of CHD when all predictor variables are zero. In practice, this might not be meaningful if zero is outside the range of your predictor variables.
   
2. **UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban**: This is the change in CHD expected with a change from Large Urban (the reference category) to Large Fringe Urban, keeping all other variables constant. The p-value is slightly more than 0.05, so this effect may not be statistically significant at the usual levels.
   
3. **UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban**: This is the change in CHD expected with a change from Large Urban to Medium or Small Urban. The positive coefficient and small p-value suggest this is associated with an increase in CHD, and this effect is statistically significant.
   
4. **UrbanRuralRural**: The expected change in CHD with a change from Large Urban to Rural. This is significantly associated with an increase in CHD.
   
5. **HighBP (High Blood Pressure)**: The expected change in CHD with a unit increase in HighBP. The positive coefficient and very small p-value suggest that higher blood pressure is significantly associated with higher CHD.

6. **Broadband**: I'm not sure what this variable represents, but its positive coefficient and small p-value suggest that an increase in Broadband is associated with an increase in CHD, assuming all other variables are held constant.

7. **Smoker**: This might represent whether the individual is a smoker or the proportion of smokers. The positive coefficient and small p-value suggest that smoking is significantly associated with higher CHD.

8. **EdLessColl (Education Less than College)**: This might represent individuals with less than college education. The positive coefficient and small p-value suggest that having less than college education is significantly associated with higher CHD.

9. **MedHouseIncome (Median Household Income)**: This might represent the median household income in an area. The negative coefficient and very small p-value suggest that higher median household income is significantly associated with lower CHD, assuming all other variables are held constant.

10. **Poverty**: This might represent the proportion of individuals in poverty in an area. The negative coefficient and small p-value suggest that higher poverty is significantly associated with lower CHD, which seems counterintuitive. It might be due to confounding variables or other complex relationships in your data. 

Remember, these interpretations are conditional on the other variables in the model. This means, for example, the effect of HighBP on CHD is estimated assuming all other variables (UrbanRural, Broadband, Smoker, EdLessColl, MedHouseIncome, Poverty) are held constant.

Also, all these interpretations are about associations, not causal relationships. Determining whether a relationship is causal is more complex and requires more than just statistical analysis.


### Linear Model with Poverty
```{r}
# Fit models to each imputed dataset
models <- with(imputed_data, exp = lm(CHD ~ UrbanRural + Poverty))

# Pool results
pooled_results <- pool(models)

# Print summary of pooled results
summary(pooled_results)
```
#### Linear Model with Poverty Explanation:
- **(Intercept)**: The expected value of CHD when all predictor variables are zero. In the context of your model, this would mean when `UrbanRural` is at its reference level (which I'm assuming is "Large_Urban") and `Poverty` is 0. It's unlikely that the zero value of Poverty has a practical interpretation in your context. So, the intercept here is more of a technical aspect of the model, rather than something you would interpret directly.

- **UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban**: This represents the expected change in CHD when the `UrbanRural` variable changes from "Large_Urban" to "LargeFringe_Urban", keeping the `Poverty` constant. The estimate of 1.441820 suggests that, on average, `CHD` is 1.441820 units higher in "LargeFringe_Urban" areas than in "Large_Urban" areas, when `Poverty` is the same in both areas. The p-value of 2.808080e-19 (very close to 0) suggests that this effect is statistically significant.

- **UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban**: This represents the expected change in CHD when `UrbanRural` changes from "Large_Urban" to "MediumSmall_Urban", with `Poverty` kept constant. The estimate suggests that, on average, `CHD` is 1.802180 units higher in "MediumSmall_Urban" areas than in "Large_Urban" areas when `Poverty` is the same. The p-value (1.664810e-31) indicates that this effect is statistically significant.

- **UrbanRuralRural**: This represents the expected change in CHD when `UrbanRural` changes from "Large_Urban" to "Rural", keeping `Poverty` constant. The estimate of 2.766099 suggests that `CHD` is, on average, 2.766099 units higher in "Rural" areas than in "Large_Urban" areas when `Poverty` is the same. The p-value (2.199503e-73) indicates this effect is statistically significant.

- **Poverty**: This represents the expected change in CHD for a one-unit increase in `Poverty`, keeping `UrbanRural` constant. The positive estimate of 0.122293 suggests that for each unit increase in `Poverty`, `CHD` increases, on average, by 0.122293 units. The p-value (5.782284e-167) indicates this effect is statistically significant.

Please note that these interpretations are based on associations, not causal relationships. The estimates give us the expected change in the outcome variable (CHD) for a unit change in the predictor variables, assuming all other predictors are held constant. However, they do not tell us whether changing the predictor variable would cause a change in the outcome. Also, be aware that other factors not included in the model could be confounding the relationships.


### Linear Model with interactions 
```{r}
# Fit models to each imputed dataset
models <- with(imputed_data, exp = lm(CHD ~ UrbanRural * HighBP + Smoker * MedHouseIncome + Broadband + EdLessColl + Poverty))

# Pool results
pooled_results <- pool(models)

# Print summary of pooled results
summary(pooled_results)

```
#### Linear Model with interactions explanation:
1. **Intercept:** The intercept of the model is approximately 2.89. In the context of this model, the intercept represents the expected value of CHD when all the predictor variables are 0. However, since some of your variables are categorical (UrbanRural), the interpretation of the intercept becomes less straightforward. 

2. **UrbanRural:** The coefficients for UrbanRural indicate the change in the expected value of CHD for a given level of UrbanRural compared to the reference level (which in this case is "Large_Urban"), while all other predictors remain constant. For example, for "MediumSmall_Urban", the expected CHD decreases by about 1.81 units compared to "Large_Urban", assuming all other variables stay constant. Keep in mind that this coefficient is not statistically significant as the p-value is larger than 0.05.

3. **HighBP:** HighBP is positively associated with CHD, with a one-unit increase in HighBP leading to a ~0.092 increase in the expected value of CHD, assuming all other variables stay constant.

4. **Smoker:** Being a smoker increases the expected value of CHD by about 0.15, assuming all other variables stay constant.

5. **MedHouseIncome:** The coefficient for MedHouseIncome is close to 0 and its p-value is greater than 0.05, suggesting that there is no significant linear relationship between MedHouseIncome and CHD when other variables are controlled.

6. **Broadband, EdLessColl, and Poverty:** Similar to HighBP and Smoker, Broadband and EdLessColl are positively associated with CHD while Poverty is negatively associated. The more detailed interpretation would be similar to what we've gone over for HighBP and Smoker.

7. **Interaction Terms:** The coefficients for the interaction terms represent how much the relationship between HighBP and CHD changes for different levels of UrbanRural and how much the relationship between Smoker and CHD changes for different levels of MedHouseIncome. For instance, the interaction term UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban:HighBP suggests that the effect of HighBP on CHD is 0.068 units higher in MediumSmall_Urban areas compared to Large_Urban areas. 

   The interpretation of interaction terms can be complex, especially when the variables involved are not continuous. The main point here is that the relationship between CHD and HighBP and between CHD and Smoker varies depending on the level of UrbanRural and MedHouseIncome, respectively.

Overall, this model provides a nuanced view of the factors influencing CHD. However, it's essential to remember that this is a statistical model that captures associations, not necessarily causal relationships. For instance, while Broadband is positively associated with CHD, we wouldn't conclude that increasing broadband availability causes an increase in coronary heart disease prevalence. The associations we observe could be influenced by a variety of other factors not included in the model.

#### Logistical regression model with CHD vs state and urban/rural features Explanation:

The glm function is used for generalized linear models, with the family parameter set to "binomial()" indicating that we are fitting a logistic regression. The response variable is CHD_bi (binary Coronary Heart Disease), and the predictors are state and UrbanRural.

**Coefficients**
This section gives the results of the model fitting.

The "Estimate" column gives the estimated coefficients for the model. For example, the coefficient for stateAL is 1.850e+01. This coefficient is in log-odds units, so to interpret it, we need to exponentiate it. The exponentiated coefficient represents the odds ratio for a one-unit increase in the corresponding predictor variable, holding all other predictors constant.

The "Std. Error" column gives the standard error of the estimates. The larger the standard error, the less certain we are about our estimate of the coefficient.

The "z value" is the estimate divided by the standard error. This is a test statistic that follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis.

The "Pr(>|z|)" column is the two-sided p-value associated with the observed value of the z-statistic. It's calculated under the null hypothesis of no effect (i.e., a coefficient of 0). If the p-value is small (usually ≤ 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the predictor is having an effect on the response. However, in this case, all of the p-values are quite high, indicating that none of the predictors are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

**Deviance Residuals**
The null deviance shows how well the response variable is predicted by a model that includes only the intercept. Lower numbers indicate a better fit. The residual deviance shows how well the response variable is predicted by the model when the predictors are included. Again, lower numbers are better.

In this case, the residual deviance is significantly lower than the null deviance, which suggests that the model with the predictors is a better fit than the null model.

**AIC**
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a measure of the relative quality of a statistical model, for a given set of data. As a method of model selection, AIC balances the complexity of a model against how well the model fits the data. The preferred model is the one with the minimum AIC. In this case, the AIC is 1725.1.

**Number of Fisher Scoring iterations**
This is the number of iterations it took for the algorithm to converge, or find the maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficients.

Overall, it appears that none of the predictors are statistically significant at the 0.05 level, according to the p-values. However, the model does a better job of predicting the response than a null model, according to the deviance. You might want to consider other predictors, or perhaps there are interactions between predictors that are not being considered in this model.

#### Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) Explanation:
Your output from the rfe function shows the results of recursive feature elimination (RFE) for different numbers of predictor variables, where the number of variables used in each model is shown in the Variables column.

For each model, several performance metrics are calculated. Here's what each of these columns mean:

Variables: This is the number of predictor variables included in the model.

**RMSE:** This is the Root Mean Squared Error of the model. It's a commonly used measure of the differences between values predicted by the model and the values actually observed. Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit.

**Rsquared:** This is the R-squared of the model, also known as the coefficient of determination. It's a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, and a higher value generally indicates a better fit of the model.

**MAE:** This is the Mean Absolute Error of the model. It's the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. It measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Like RMSE, lower values indicate better fit.

**RMSESD:** This is the standard deviation of the RMSE over the cross-validation folds. A lower value indicates that the model's performance is more consistent across different subsets of the data.

**RsquaredSD:* This is the standard deviation of the R-squared values over the cross-validation folds. A lower value indicates that the model's performance is more consistent across different subsets of the data.

From these results, you can see how the model performance changes as you include more predictor variables.

Looking at the output, it appears that the model performs extremely well with just one or two variables, achieving very high R-squared values and very low RMSE, MAE values. However, it's important to be cautious here, as these results might be too good to be true and could suggest overfitting. Overfitting is when the model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on new, unseen data.

Additionally, the performance seems to decrease (i.e., RMSE and MAE increase, and Rsquared decreases) as more variables are added, up to a certain point, after which it starts to increase again. This could suggest that some of the variables are not useful for prediction and might even be detrimental.

However, the standard deviations (RMSESD, RsquaredSD) also increase as more variables are added, indicating that the model's performance becomes less consistent across different subsets of the data.

These results can help you decide how many and which variables to include in your final model. You might choose the model with the highest R-squared, or you might choose a simpler model if it performs almost as well. The choice depends on your specific goals and constraints, such as how important interpretability is and how much computational resources you have.

```


#### Use the model to predict outcomes with the simulated data

predictions_simulation_pcp <- predict(model, data_simulation_pcp)

```


#### Compare the original predictions and the simulated predictions

We will subset the dataset to include only the variables of interest:
# Subset the dataset
```{r}
cdc2 <- cdc[c("CHD", "pcp", "PhysInactivity", "Parks", "Broadband", "HealthIns")]

```
Now, let's split the data into training, testing, and holdout sets. We'll use 70% of the data for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for holdout:

# Set the seed for reproducibility
```{r}
set.seed(2112)

```


# Create indices for the data split
```{r}
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(cdc2$CHD, p = .7, list = FALSE, times = 1)
```


# Split the data
```{r}
train <- cdc2[trainIndex, ]
temp <- cdc2[-trainIndex, ]

```


# Further split the remaining data into test and holdout sets
```{r}
testIndex <- createDataPartition(temp$CHD, p = .5, list = FALSE, times = 1)
test <- temp[testIndex, ]
holdout <- temp[-testIndex, ]

```
Now, let's create the linear regression model using the training set:


# Create the linear regression model
```{r}
model <- lm(CHD ~ pcp * PhysInactivity * Parks * Broadband * HealthIns, data = train)

```
We can now use this model to make predictions on the test set:


# Make predictions on the test set
```{r}
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test)

```
To compare the model's performance before and after increasing the 'Broadband' variable by 25%, we first need to create a new dataset with the increased 'Broadband' values:


# Create a new dataset with increased 'Broadband' values
```{r}
cdc_increased <- cdc2
cdc_increased$Broadband <- cdc_increased$Broadband * 1.25

```
Then, we split this new dataset into training, testing, and holdout sets, and create a new model:


# Split the new data
```{r}
train_increased <- cdc_increased[trainIndex, ]
temp_increased <- cdc_increased[-trainIndex, ]
test_increased <- temp_increased[testIndex, ]
holdout_increased <- temp_increased[-testIndex, ]

```


# Create the new model
```{r}
model_increased <- lm(CHD ~ pcp + PhysInactivity + Parks + Broadband + HealthIns, data = train_increased)

```


# Make predictions on the new test set
```{r}
predictions_increased <- predict(model_increased, newdata = test_increased)

```
Now, you can compare the performance of the two models using your preferred metrics (e.g., RMSE, R-squared, etc.). For example:


# Calculate RMSE for the original model
```{r}
rmse_original <- sqrt(mean((test$CHD - predictions)^2))

```


# Calculate RMSE for the new model
```{r}
rmse_increased <- sqrt(mean((test_increased$CHD - predictions_increased)^2))

```


# Print the RMSE values
```{r}
print(paste("RMSE for the original model: ", rmse_original))
print(paste("RMSE for the model with increased Broadband: ", rmse_increased))

```
Please note that this is a basic example and might need adjustments based on the specifics of your dataset and project. For example, you might need to handle missing values, outliers, or non-linear relationships between the variables. Also, linear regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed and that there is a linear relationship between the predictors and the target variable, among other assumptions. You should check these assumptions when using linear regression.

correlation_df <- subset(correlation_df, Var1 < Var2)

# Add an absolute value of correlation to the dataframe

```
Now, to interpret these outputs:

In both cases, you have trained models with 1 to 36 variables (from only one variable in the model to all 36 variables in the model). The sizes argument in the rfe() function defined this.

In both models (rural and urban), the model with 36 variables was selected as the best model (marked with '*'). This was based on the lowest RMSE.

When comparing the rural and urban models, it appears that the model for the urban areas performs slightly better than the model for the rural areas, as it has a lower RMSE (0.3985 vs. 0.4062) and a higher R-squared (0.9314 vs. 0.9166). However, the difference is quite small and might not be significant.

Regarding the top predictors (variables that help predict CHD), it's interesting to note that for both rural and urban areas, "Stroke", "Age65Plus", "HighChol", and "Smoker" are in the top 5. This suggests that these variables are important in predicting CHD, regardless of whether the area is urban or rural. However, the importance of other variables might differ between urban and rural areas.

For example, "bpmUse" (I assume this refers to the use of blood pressure medication) is in the top 5 for both rural and urban, but "HighBP" (high blood pressure) is in the top 5 for rural areas but not for urban ones. This difference might suggest that the management of high blood pressure is more critical in rural areas when it comes to CHD.

When you look at the top variables in the full list of 36, you can see that some variables, like "AirQuality" and "Poverty", are more important in rural areas than in urban areas, while variables like "PhysInactivity" and "Unemploy" appear to be more significant in urban areas.

In these new outputs, you've trained models with 1 to 7 variables and then jumped to 36 variables for comparison. Again, the model with 7 variables is selected as the best model in both rural and urban cases (as indicated by the '*') based on the lowest RMSE.

Let's discuss the rural model first:

The top 7 variables are "Stroke", "Age65Plus", "HighChol", "HighBP", "bpmUse", "Smoker", and "EdLessColl". The model's performance in terms of RMSE, R-squared, and MAE has improved as you add more variables until it reaches 7. The RMSE decreases from 0.6448 (for 1 variable) to 0.3991 (for 7 variables). R-squared increases from 0.7876 to 0.9218, indicating that the model with 7 variables can explain more variation in the response variable. The model's MAE decreases as well, suggesting a better fit.

In the urban model:

The top 7 variables are "Stroke", "Age65Plus", "HighChol", "bpmUse", "HighBP", "EdLessColl", and "Smoker". The order is slightly different from the rural model, suggesting that different factors might be more important in urban areas compared to rural areas. The model's performance in terms of RMSE, R-squared, and MAE again improves as you add more variables until it reaches 7, just like in the rural model. The RMSE decreases from 0.6079 (for 1 variable) to 0.3819 (for 7 variables), and R-squared increases from 0.8218 to 0.9342. Again, the model's MAE decreases as more variables are added.

When comparing the rural and urban models, it seems that the urban model is performing slightly better, as its RMSE is lower (0.3819 vs. 0.3991), and R-squared is higher (0.9342 vs. 0.9218). However, the difference is quite small.

These results show that while the model with all 36 variables does perform well, a model with only the top 7 variables can achieve almost as good performance. This finding is important because simpler models (i.e., models with fewer variables) are often preferred in practice because they are easier to interpret and can avoid overfitting. 

In terms of variable importance, "Stroke", "Age65Plus", "HighChol", "HighBP", "bpmUse", "Smoker", and "EdLessColl" are the top variables in both rural and urban areas, suggesting that these variables are universally important in predicting CHD. 

Remember, the interpretation of these results should be made in the context of the data and subject area. While these models indicate these variables are important predictors of CHD, further research is needed to understand why they are important and how they might interact with each other.
