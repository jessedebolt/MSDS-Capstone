## Data cleansing 
### Removing US territories
```{r}

cdc <- cdc %>%
  mutate(count_na = apply(., 1, count_na_func)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_na))

```


### Remove counties with minimal data
```{r}
# Remove those that have more than 8 NAs in that row
cdc <- cdc[cdc$count_na <= 8, ]

# Remove count_na column
cdc$count_na <- NULL

```

```
#### Linear Model with CHD vs various features Explanation:
**Residuals:**
The "Residuals" section provides information about the errors or residuals of the model. Residuals are the differences between the actual observed values and the predicted values from the regression model. This section displays summary statistics of the residuals, including the minimum, first quartile (1Q), median, third quartile (3Q), and maximum values.
In your model, the minimum residual is -4.1947, the first quartile is -0.6105, the median is -0.0589, the third quartile is 0.5536, and the maximum residual is 6.8327.

**Coefficients:**
The "Coefficients" section provides the estimated coefficients of the independent variables in the linear regression model. Each coefficient represents the expected change in the dependent variable (CHD) associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding other variables constant.
For example, the estimated coefficient for "CardioPhys" is -0.005596, indicating that, on average, for each unit increase in the "CardioPhys" variable, the dependent variable "CHD" is expected to decrease by approximately 0.005596 units, assuming all other variables are held constant.

The "Estimate" column shows the estimated coefficient values, the "Std. Error" column provides the standard errors of the estimates, and the "t value" column gives the t-statistic for testing whether the coefficient is significantly different from zero. The "Pr(>|t|)" column represents the p-value associated with the t-statistic, indicating the statistical significance of the coefficient. Lower p-values indicate greater significance.

In your model, all the coefficients have p-values less than 0.05, denoted by three asterisks (***), indicating that all the variables are statistically significant in explaining the variation in the dependent variable.

**Residual standard error:**
The "Residual standard error" is an estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals. It represents the average amount by which the observed values deviate from the predicted values. In your model, the residual standard error is 1.029.

**Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:**
The "Multiple R-squared" is a measure of how well the linear regression model fits the data. It indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. In your model, the multiple R-squared value is 0.5756, meaning that approximately 57.56% of the variance in the dependent variable "CHD" is explained by the independent variables in the model.

The "Adjusted R-squared" adjusts the multiple R-squared value for the number of independent variables and the sample size. It penalizes the addition of irrelevant variables that do not contribute much to the model's explanatory power. The adjusted R-squared value in your model is 0.5748.

**F-statistic:**
The F-statistic is a measure of overall significance in the linear regression model. It tests the null hypothesis that all the coefficients in the model are equal to zero, indicating that none of the independent variables have a significant relationship with the dependent variable. A low p-value (typically below 0.05) suggests that the model as a whole is statistically significant.
In your model, the F-statistic is 708.3, and the associated p-value is < 2.2e-16, which is essentially zero. This extremely low p-value indicates that the overall model is statistically significant, and at least one of the independent variables has a significant relationship with the dependent variable.

In summary, the linear regression model explains approximately 57.56% of the variance in the dependent variable "CHD." The coefficients of the independent variables are statistically significant, indicating that they have a significant relationship with "CHD" when controlling for other variables in the model. The model as a whole is statistically significant, suggesting that it provides valuable information in predicting the dependent variable.

```
#### Linear Model with CHD vs Urban Rural Explanation:
**Intercept (Large_Urban)**: In this model, "Large_Urban" is the reference category because it is represented by the intercept. The intercept's value of approximately 5.79 is the average CHD prevalence in "Large_Urban" areas (given that the CHD data and coefficients are in a format where this interpretation makes sense).

**LargeFringe_Urban**: The coefficient of approximately 1.01 suggests that, on average, the CHD prevalence in "LargeFringe_Urban" areas is estimated to be about 1.01 units higher than in "Large_Urban" areas.

**MediumSmall_Urban**: Similarly, the CHD prevalence in "MediumSmall_Urban" areas is estimated to be about 1.80 units higher than in "Large_Urban" areas.

**Rural**: Lastly, the CHD prevalence in "Rural" areas is estimated to be about 2.98 units higher than in "Large_Urban" areas.

For all categories of "UrbanRural", the p-values are less than 0.05, which suggests that the differences in CHD prevalence between "Large_Urban" areas and the other types of areas are statistically significant.

In other words, your model suggests that there is a significant association between the type of area and CHD prevalence. Specifically, all other types of areas have higher estimated CHD prevalence than "Large_Urban" areas.


### Linear Model CHD vs Urban Rural + HighBP
```{r}
# Fit models to each imputed dataset
models <- with(imputed_data, exp = lm(CHD ~ UrbanRural + HighBP))

# Pool results
pooled_results <- pool(models)

# Print summary of pooled results
summary(pooled_results)

```
#### Linear Model CHD vs Urban Rural + HighBP Explanation:
In your output, each row corresponds to a term in the model, and each column corresponds to an aspect of the term.

- **term**: This is the name of the variable in the model. "(Intercept)" refers to the model's intercept, or baseline outcome when all the predictors are 0. In your case, "UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban", "UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban", and "UrbanRuralRural" are dummy variables derived from the categorical variable "UrbanRural", and "HighBP" is a variable representing high blood pressure.

- **estimate**: This is the estimated coefficient for the term in the model. For example, the estimate for "HighBP" is 0.1983978. In the context of this model, it means that for each unit increase in "HighBP", we would expect an increase of 0.1983978 units in "CHD", holding all other variables constant.

- **std.error**: This is the standard error of the estimated coefficient. It measures the variability in the estimate. A smaller standard error means the estimate is more precise.

- **statistic**: This is the t-statistic for the term. It is the ratio of the estimate to the standard error. The t-statistic follows a t-distribution under the null hypothesis that the true coefficient is zero. A larger absolute value of the t-statistic means it is further from zero, which provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

- **df**: This is the degrees of freedom for the t-statistic.

- **p.value**: This is the p-value for the hypothesis test of whether the coefficient is zero. A smaller p-value means there is stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, i.e., stronger evidence that the coefficient is not zero.

In your output, all the p-values are very small, which suggests that each term in the model is significantly related to "CHD". Specifically:

- For a county that's "UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban" versus "Large_Urban", the expected "CHD" increases by 0.2928782 units, holding all other variables constant.
- For a county that's "UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban" versus "Large_Urban", the expected "CHD" increases by 0.7978104 units, holding all other variables constant.
- For a county that's "UrbanRuralRural" versus "Large_Urban", the expected "CHD" increases by 1.4393493 units, holding all other variables constant.
- For each unit increase in "HighBP", the expected "CHD" increases by 0.1983978 units, holding all other variables constant.

Therefore, your model suggests that "HighBP" and "UrbanRural" are both significant predictors of "CHD", with "HighBP" being a particularly strong predictor given its large t-statistic. This matches with what you might expect given that high blood pressure is known to be a risk factor for coronary heart disease.


### Linear Model with various variables

# Fit models to each imputed dataset
models <- with(imputed_data, exp = lm(CHD ~ UrbanRural + HighBP + Broadband + Smoker + EdLessColl + MedHouseIncome + Poverty)) 

# Pool results

# Print summary of pooled results
summary(pooled_results)

```
#### Linear Model with various variables Explanation:
1. **(Intercept)**: The expected value of CHD when all predictor variables are zero. In practice, this might not be meaningful if zero is outside the range of your predictor variables.
   
2. **UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban**: This is the change in CHD expected with a change from Large Urban (the reference category) to Large Fringe Urban, keeping all other variables constant. The p-value is slightly more than 0.05, so this effect may not be statistically significant at the usual levels.
   
3. **UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban**: This is the change in CHD expected with a change from Large Urban to Medium or Small Urban. The positive coefficient and small p-value suggest this is associated with an increase in CHD, and this effect is statistically significant.
   
4. **UrbanRuralRural**: The expected change in CHD with a change from Large Urban to Rural. This is significantly associated with an increase in CHD.
   
5. **HighBP (High Blood Pressure)**: The expected change in CHD with a unit increase in HighBP. The positive coefficient and very small p-value suggest that higher blood pressure is significantly associated with higher CHD.

6. **Broadband**: I'm not sure what this variable represents, but its positive coefficient and small p-value suggest that an increase in Broadband is associated with an increase in CHD, assuming all other variables are held constant.

7. **Smoker**: This might represent whether the individual is a smoker or the proportion of smokers. The positive coefficient and small p-value suggest that smoking is significantly associated with higher CHD.

8. **EdLessColl (Education Less than College)**: This might represent individuals with less than college education. The positive coefficient and small p-value suggest that having less than college education is significantly associated with higher CHD.

9. **MedHouseIncome (Median Household Income)**: This might represent the median household income in an area. The negative coefficient and very small p-value suggest that higher median household income is significantly associated with lower CHD, assuming all other variables are held constant.

10. **Poverty**: This might represent the proportion of individuals in poverty in an area. The negative coefficient and small p-value suggest that higher poverty is significantly associated with lower CHD, which seems counterintuitive. It might be due to confounding variables or other complex relationships in your data. 

Remember, these interpretations are conditional on the other variables in the model. This means, for example, the effect of HighBP on CHD is estimated assuming all other variables (UrbanRural, Broadband, Smoker, EdLessColl, MedHouseIncome, Poverty) are held constant.

Also, all these interpretations are about associations, not causal relationships. Determining whether a relationship is causal is more complex and requires more than just statistical analysis.


### Linear Model with Poverty
```{r}
# Fit models to each imputed dataset
models <- with(imputed_data, exp = lm(CHD ~ UrbanRural + Poverty))

# Pool results
pooled_results <- pool(models)

# Print summary of pooled results
summary(pooled_results)
```
#### Linear Model with Poverty Explanation:
- **(Intercept)**: The expected value of CHD when all predictor variables are zero. In the context of your model, this would mean when `UrbanRural` is at its reference level (which I'm assuming is "Large_Urban") and `Poverty` is 0. It's unlikely that the zero value of Poverty has a practical interpretation in your context. So, the intercept here is more of a technical aspect of the model, rather than something you would interpret directly.

- **UrbanRuralLargeFringe_Urban**: This represents the expected change in CHD when the `UrbanRural` variable changes from "Large_Urban" to "LargeFringe_Urban", keeping the `Poverty` constant. The estimate of 1.441820 suggests that, on average, `CHD` is 1.441820 units higher in "LargeFringe_Urban" areas than in "Large_Urban" areas, when `Poverty` is the same in both areas. The p-value of 2.808080e-19 (very close to 0) suggests that this effect is statistically significant.

- **UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban**: This represents the expected change in CHD when `UrbanRural` changes from "Large_Urban" to "MediumSmall_Urban", with `Poverty` kept constant. The estimate suggests that, on average, `CHD` is 1.802180 units higher in "MediumSmall_Urban" areas than in "Large_Urban" areas when `Poverty` is the same. The p-value (1.664810e-31) indicates that this effect is statistically significant.

- **UrbanRuralRural**: This represents the expected change in CHD when `UrbanRural` changes from "Large_Urban" to "Rural", keeping `Poverty` constant. The estimate of 2.766099 suggests that `CHD` is, on average, 2.766099 units higher in "Rural" areas than in "Large_Urban" areas when `Poverty` is the same. The p-value (2.199503e-73) indicates this effect is statistically significant.

- **Poverty**: This represents the expected change in CHD for a one-unit increase in `Poverty`, keeping `UrbanRural` constant. The positive estimate of 0.122293 suggests that for each unit increase in `Poverty`, `CHD` increases, on average, by 0.122293 units. The p-value (5.782284e-167) indicates this effect is statistically significant.

Please note that these interpretations are based on associations, not causal relationships. The estimates give us the expected change in the outcome variable (CHD) for a unit change in the predictor variables, assuming all other predictors are held constant. However, they do not tell us whether changing the predictor variable would cause a change in the outcome. Also, be aware that other factors not included in the model could be confounding the relationships.


### Linear Model with interactions 
```{r}
# Fit models to each imputed dataset
models <- with(imputed_data, exp = lm(CHD ~ UrbanRural * HighBP + Smoker * MedHouseIncome + Broadband + EdLessColl + Poverty))

# Pool results
pooled_results <- pool(models)

# Print summary of pooled results
summary(pooled_results)

```
#### Linear Model with interactions explanation:
1. **Intercept:** The intercept of the model is approximately 2.89. In the context of this model, the intercept represents the expected value of CHD when all the predictor variables are 0. However, since some of your variables are categorical (UrbanRural), the interpretation of the intercept becomes less straightforward. 

2. **UrbanRural:** The coefficients for UrbanRural indicate the change in the expected value of CHD for a given level of UrbanRural compared to the reference level (which in this case is "Large_Urban"), while all other predictors remain constant. For example, for "MediumSmall_Urban", the expected CHD decreases by about 1.81 units compared to "Large_Urban", assuming all other variables stay constant. Keep in mind that this coefficient is not statistically significant as the p-value is larger than 0.05.

3. **HighBP:** HighBP is positively associated with CHD, with a one-unit increase in HighBP leading to a ~0.092 increase in the expected value of CHD, assuming all other variables stay constant.

4. **Smoker:** Being a smoker increases the expected value of CHD by about 0.15, assuming all other variables stay constant.

5. **MedHouseIncome:** The coefficient for MedHouseIncome is close to 0 and its p-value is greater than 0.05, suggesting that there is no significant linear relationship between MedHouseIncome and CHD when other variables are controlled.

6. **Broadband, EdLessColl, and Poverty:** Similar to HighBP and Smoker, Broadband and EdLessColl are positively associated with CHD while Poverty is negatively associated. The more detailed interpretation would be similar to what we've gone over for HighBP and Smoker.

7. **Interaction Terms:** The coefficients for the interaction terms represent how much the relationship between HighBP and CHD changes for different levels of UrbanRural and how much the relationship between Smoker and CHD changes for different levels of MedHouseIncome. For instance, the interaction term UrbanRuralMediumSmall_Urban:HighBP suggests that the effect of HighBP on CHD is 0.068 units higher in MediumSmall_Urban areas compared to Large_Urban areas. 

   The interpretation of interaction terms can be complex, especially when the variables involved are not continuous. The main point here is that the relationship between CHD and HighBP and between CHD and Smoker varies depending on the level of UrbanRural and MedHouseIncome, respectively.

Overall, this model provides a nuanced view of the factors influencing CHD. However, it's essential to remember that this is a statistical model that captures associations, not necessarily causal relationships. For instance, while Broadband is positively associated with CHD, we wouldn't conclude that increasing broadband availability causes an increase in coronary heart disease prevalence. The associations we observe could be influenced by a variety of other factors not included in the model.
